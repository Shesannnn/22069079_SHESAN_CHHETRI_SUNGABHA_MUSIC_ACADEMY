"The Argument for Music Education" enumerates the many benefits of music education, broadly categorized into indirect benefits, incentive benefits, and intangible benefits. Indirect benefits are increased brain function through music education which improves cognitive functioning thus serving to improve the academic performance in schools. The incentive benefits highlight the educational benefits occurring due to engagement in music programs; these have been related to graduation rates, college attendance, etc. In addition, there are intangible benefits, in the development of empathy, regulation of emotions, and social skills, though they are very much harder to quantify, bear strongly on personal growth. It points out that, through music training, one gets an understanding of speech in noise and, basically, a force for social change. It mentions programs such as the Harmony Project, which teaches children from the most economically disadvantaged areas music at no cost, and indeed sees a significant boost in academic performance and personal development. All in all, the paper supports the inclusion of music education in schools because of its long-lasting effect on the individual and society as a whole.
